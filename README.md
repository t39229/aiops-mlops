AIOps and MLOps Phases
AI and MLOps have different phases in their lifecycle, ensuring smooth
development, deployment, and maintenance of machine learning models. Here’s a
breakdown of their key phases:
1. AI Lifecycle Phases
These phases focus on building, training, and evaluating a machine learning
model.
1.1 Data Collection & Preprocessing
Purpose
● Load data from a source
● Split into training and testing sets
● Standardize numerical values for consistency

Why is this important?
✔️ Ensures models receive clean, standardized data
✔️ Prevents features with larger numerical ranges from dominating others


1.2 Feature Engineering
Purpose
● Select the most relevant features
● Improve model accuracy by eliminating irrelevant features

Why is this important?
✔️ Reduces dimensionality, improving speed
✔️ Removes irrelevant or redundant features


1.3 Model Training & Evaluation
Purpose
● Train a model on labeled data
● Evaluate how well it performs

Why is this important?
✔️ Determines model effectiveness
✔️ Helps identify if further improvements are needed


1.4 Hyperparameter Tuning
Purpose
● Optimize model settings for better accuracy

Why is this important?
✔️ Avoids underfitting/overfitting
✔️ Improves prediction accuracy


2. MLOps Phases
These phases help automate, deploy, and monitor AI models.
2.1 Model Versioning
Purpose
● Keep track of different trained models
● Allow easy rollback to previous models

Why is this important?
✔️ Enables collaboration across teams
✔️ Ensures reproducibility

2.2 Model Deployment
Purpose
● Make the model available via an API

Why is this important?
✔️ Allows real-time predictions via API
✔️ Supports integration with applications

2.3 Model Monitoring
Purpose
● Track model performance in production

✔️ Ensures model reliability
✔️ Detects performance degradation

2.4 Automating with CI/CD
Purpose
● Automate training, testing, and deployment

Why is this important?
✔️ Reduces deployment time
✔️ Automates testing and updates

Final AI & MLOps Workflow
1. Data Collection & Preprocessing → Cleaning and preparing data
2. Feature Engineering → Selecting important features
3. Model Training & Evaluation → Training and testing the model
4. Hyperparameter Tuning → Optimizing model settings
5. Model Versioning (MLflow) → Keeping track of model versions
6. Model Deployment (Flask API + Docker) → Serving the model
7. Model Monitoring (Prometheus) → Tracking performance
8. CI/CD Automation (GitHub Actions + DockerHub) → Automating
